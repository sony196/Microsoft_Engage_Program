# car features predictor
- This car features predictor is about predicting the some of the features of car. For example, milege,Fuel capacity,engine size etc
- This web application can predict 9 features of car and it contains a dashboard where we can get visual idea about features
# overview
- This app is very useful to the person who wants to know much information about features of car 
- I have taken the dataset in which I gathered information from various datasets
- I have trained machine learning models on the features for which I need to do predictions 
- In each machine learning models I got around 80-90% accuracy 
- I have used machine learning algorithms like LinearRegression , RandomForestRegressor,Ridge,DecisionForestRegressor. 
- I have made predictions on 9 features
- I have focused on Explorative data analysis and machine learning models
- This application is developed by using python , streamlite , css

 # Data Source
- I have made the dataset my gathering information from various datasets.The dataset you can get [here](https://github.com/sony196/app123/files/8791509/car_data.csv)
